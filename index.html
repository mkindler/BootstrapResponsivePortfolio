                <p>Greetings! My name is Mae Kindler, and I currently live in Saint Paul, Minnesota. I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities in 2012. While science is amazing, I found myself overwhelmed by how many different career directions I wanted to go following graduation. Needless to say, the direction in which my career ultimately took me was completely unexpected.</p>
                <p>Since 2013, I have spent my career working in college access and success, including a two-year position with the Saint Paul-based non-profit College Possible as their AmeriCorps College Relations VISTA. College Possible's mission is to <i>make college admission and success possible for students from low-income backgrounds through an intensive curriculum of coaching and support.</i> This position allowed me to work behind the scenes on college partnerships as well as directly with current college students, supporting them 1:1 through their college journeys.</p>
                <p>Following College Possible, I began the next phase of my career with another non-profit, Big Brothers Big Sisters, whose mission is to <i>create and support mentoring relationships that ignite the power and promise of youth.</i> Over the last five years, my position has encompassed several responsibilities, but the heart of my work has remained in college access and success for the teen participants in the program.</p>
                <p>Fast-forward to 2020, I am continuing to work full-time with Big Brothers Big Sisters while attending a fast-paced, six-month Coding Bootcamp through the University of Minnesota Twin Cities in partnership with Trilogy Education Services to become a certified Full-Stack Web Developer. Unexpected career shift ahead? That's the goal. We'll see what's next!</p>
