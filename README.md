# BootstrapResponsivePortfolio

## Description

This project utilizes the `Bootstrap CSS Framework` to create a mobile responsive personal portfolio for Mae Kindler.

## Task

By utilizing Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns), and taking a variety of mobile device screen sizes, from `xs` and larger, into consideration, a fully-functional, deployable online portfolio has been created.

Included within this portfolio are three main pages, as follows:

* <b>About Me:</b> Shares information about who Mae Kindler is, where she currently works, and what some of her passions are.

* <b>Contact:</b> A form that is designed to collect messages and contact information from users who visit the site and want to connect further with Mae. <i>As of October 10th, 2020, this form is not yet functional, but will be updated for functionality in the near future.</i>

* <b>Portfolio:</b> Displays thumbnails of projects that Mae has worked on; however, the current thumbnail photos displayed are <b>just placeholders</b>.

## Usage

This online portfolio can be shared with those who are interested in learning more about who Mae Kindler is, including her background, education, current career, and passions.  Additionally, those who visit the website are provided with the opportunity to contact Mae, should they wish to connect further.

<i>Please note: At this time, the Contact form is not yet functional, and the Portfolio page will be updated to include actual projects completed by Mae as they are finished.</i>

## Installation

This project will require a user to have:
* `Git Bash` (Windows), `Terminal` (Mac), or another application for executing commands to/from one's local machine.
* Code editor installed, such as `Visual Studio Code`.
* Access to `Bootstrap`, which is freely available online at https://getbootstrap.com/.
* Version control system, such as `GitHub`, to fork, clone, push, and pull the original repository, and to upload the final project to one's own version control system account.

## Process

This project began with the creation of three separate `html` files, including `index.html`, `portfolio.html`, and `contact.html`. A separate CSS stylesheet was also created to adjust certain aesthetic features of the overall online portfolio as the project progressed. Finally, the `BootstrapCDN` was incorporated into each `html` file to ensure all aspects of the online portfolio function as designed while maintaining mobile responsiveness.

<i>Although an attempt was made to properly add a sticky footer to the overall portfolio, the code provided in HTML and CSS is <b>not</b> adjusted as desired. Additional edits will be made on the footer over time.</i>
